  <h1>Geometry and friction</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <h3>Quantifying the effects of geometry on friction coefficients</h3>
  <p>Although friction is one of the most ubiquitous forces in everyday life and in applications of physics,
    it is extremely difficult to model. In order to simplify dealing with friction, it is generally assumed
    that surface area has no effect on friction; however, this has been shown to be incorrect in some cases.
    The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of geometry on friction both experimentally
    and through theoretical modeling. The first stage of the experiment tested friction experimentally.
    The first hypothesis was that if blocks with varying surface geometries are slid down a steel ramp,
    then the surface geometry consisting of small cones will have the highest coefficient of friction.
    The second hypothesis was that if models are compared to experimental results for the effects of
    geometry on friction, then the computer model using small springs that break at the fracture point
    will be the closest to the experimental results. Neither hypothesis was supported by the data. However,
    a model using small beams projecting into the steel ramp was able to estimate coefficients of friction
    with a signed percent error of (40 Â± 50)%. This indicates that something like the beam model is involved
    in frictional effects, but is likely not the only factor. Further research is needed to model the
    geometry of friction incorporating more factors such as different materials and shapes as well as more
    precise information on the microstructure of steel.</p><br><br>
